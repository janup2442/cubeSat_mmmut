# PLanetScope #
## 1. Dove-1 and Dove-2 cubesat constellation ##
  - Objective is to use low cost COTS components for development of cubesat
  - Dove-1 and Dove-2 featured identical sensors, which included a singular optical telescope payload with a 90 mm aperture and a high-resolution camera. The camera direction determined its purpose, with the nadir-pointing camera used for surface imaging, and the upwards-pointing camera used for debris tracking.
  - Launched in 300-400 Km orbit (51.6 deg) and 575km SSO (64.9 deg)  respectively.
  - Exact information about which OBC and payload have been used is not publicily available.
  - captures images at GSD 4.4m
  - both operate in near cirular orbit in sso range.
