## 1. Go through previous missions  (done) ##
## 2. define mission requirements (done) ##
- Size 3U
- Objective : telemetry and Earth imaging with at least 4 bands spectrums (budget concers , space qualified cameras are too expensive)

## 3. Spatial Assumptions ##
- Will be released at 400-600Km altitude.
- will orbit in SSO
- based on data , after release its velocity will be around 7500+ m/s , with that speed roughly It will take say 95 min to complete one orbit
- Based on that in 24 hrs , it will complete 15-16 orbits , in which ground pass will be only happen for 4-5 times (in that 4-5 times/day , ground pass we have to connect via Radio tlm).

## Design Specifications ##
- There are certain design specifications , which we need to follow , they will ensure that our cubesat will be accepted for the ride to space at design level.
- Deployers / Dispensers are pre-configured with these desgin specifications so we need to follow the same.
